It is a blog about me and it is just to show my <strong class="HTML2">HTML</strong> & <strong class="CSS2">CSS</strong> skills so please feel free to look at my code and see what you think. I hope you like my work and I do intend to do more web pages and projects to showcase my skills.

	<h2>More About Me</h2>

	<p class="quote">
		I have been employed as an Senior Service Technician at Alpha Electronics for the past ten years, tasked with calibrating and testing electronic equipment. Whilst I have enjoyed working with my current employer, I have reached the point where I would very much like to advance my career by moving into software and web development, which I find very rewarding and interesting. I found that programming and problem solving was very interesting and quickly realised that software or web development was an area that I would really like to get into. In my spare time, I am working through courses covering C# & SQL, creating simple applications such as a Roman Numeral Converter which basically converts numbers into roman numerals. I am also currently developing a C# application for my current workplace as well as creating my own SQL database for my personal use.

	<p>
		Even though I have just started to learn programming and developing my own projects, I would like the opportunity to continue learning full time in a true working environment.
